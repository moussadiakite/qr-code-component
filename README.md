## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS Media queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned:
- how to use Semantic HTML5 tags like main and article to better structure my code and make it more accessible.
- by default the size of an h1 title tag can change inside an article tag
- use flexbox to align elements vertically and horizontally

```css
.parent-container {
  display: flex; /* going to use flexbox */
  align-items: center; /* center vertically */
  justify-content: center; /* center horizontally */
}
```

### Continued development

Adding a dark mode.
